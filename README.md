- 👋 Hi, I’m Konrad
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in Python, Java, JavaScript, C++ and C# as well as video editing with Vegas Pro 19 and image manipulation in GIMP.
<!-- - 🌱 I’m currently learning creating Windows Forms applications using the .NET Framework for C#. -->
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to locally host web servers, how to create frond-end applications using React and how to serve back-end services using Node.js. I'm also working on some personal projects involving Python, such as a Discord bot and cryptocurrency trading automation tool.
- ✈️ In the future I'm hoping to further expand my horizons, learning more back-end languages such as Rust.
