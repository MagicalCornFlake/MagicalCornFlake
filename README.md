- 👋 Hi, I’m Konrad!
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in Python, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Rust, C/C++, and C#. I also enjoy video editing using Vegas Pro 19 and image manipulation in GIMP.
<!-- - 🌱 I’m currently learning creating Windows Forms applications using the .NET Framework for C#. -->
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to locally host web servers, how to create frond-end applications using React and how to serve back-end services using Node.js. Additionally, I'm currently working on some personal projects involving Python, such as a Discord bot and cryptocurrency trading automation tool.
- ✈️ In the future I'm hoping to further expand my horizons, learning more back-end languages such as Rust. It's more my kind of language; I enjoy mostly server-side development, such as implementing REST interfaces. 
<!--- - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... N/A --->
