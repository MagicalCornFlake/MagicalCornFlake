## About *kguzek*

Hello! I'm a computer science engineering student based in Poland with a passion for programming. I love both front- and back-end development, but I absolutely hate UI design. This is why I believe in the paramount importance of engineer-designer cooperation.

I enjoy: programming mods for various games in languages like **C#**, **Java**, and **Lua**; developing tool-oriented software like desktop or CLI applications using **C**, **C#** or **Python**; and creating full service web applications and server infrastructure with **JavaScript** or **TypeScript** (I know, sorry, but I'm a fan of **Node.js**). Apart from programming I also like to dabble in system administration, hosting my own Raspberry Pi server and the endless configuration of Linux distros.

If you would like to collaborate on a project or have any other inquiry, I welcome your emails at `(my forename) at (my surname) dot (United Kingdom TLD)`.
